# VBA_Challenge Module 2

##  Overview of Project

This challenge focused on the refractor of coding. Steve had us pull the green stock analysis together, calculating the Annual Volume and the Annual return for each stock for 2017 and 2018. In the process we made the code livable, so it could grow with Steve as the years passed. Now it was time to see if we could make the code more efficient. Efficiency comes in many forms such as:

    -Less Lines of Codes
    -Utilization of Less Memory
    -Better Logic
    -Easier to Read

Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
